# Remote repositories allow you to collaborate with others by pushing your local code to GitHub and pulling updates from others.


1. Connecting to a Remote Repository
You can link your local repository to a remote one (like GitHub). To do this, you need the URL of your GitHub repository.

    git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL> (origin is the default name given to the remote repository, but you can name it something else if you like.)
    (This command will only link to repository and not download all files )

    - To download all files of linked remote repository use pull command 
    -  git pull origin main
     # OR clone the repository

     - git clone <remote_repository_URL>


You can verify the remote repository using:
 - git remote -v


2. Pushing Changes to GitHub
After making commits, you can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub. If you haven't already created a branch on GitHub, you'll need to push the current branch.
 - git push -u origin <branch_name>


3. Pulling Changes from GitHub
When collaborating with others, youâ€™ll need to pull changes from GitHub to update your local repository with new commits.
 - git pull


4. Cloning a Repository
If you want to download a GitHub repository onto your local machine, you use the git clone command.
 - git clone <remote_repository_URL>
