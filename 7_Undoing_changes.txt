 # Undoing Changes in Git
Git provides several ways to undo changes, depending on what you want to do. Whether it's modifying a commit, undoing staged changes, or discarding local changes, Git gives you flexibility in how to revert or reset your work.

1. Unstage a file (after using git add): If you accidentally added a file to the staging area and want to unstage it:

    git reset <file_name>


2. Discard all local changes (to a file, before committing): If you want to undo changes made to a file and revert it back to the last committed state:

    git checkout -- <file_name>

3. Amend the last commit: If you've already committed but want to modify the most recent commit (e.g., to change the commit message or add new changes):

    git commit --amend
