To begin tracking your project with Git, you need to initialize a repository. This creates a hidden .git folder, 
where Git stores all of its configuration and history for the project.


# git init :- This initializes an empty Git repository in your project folder.



## Configuring User Information
Before you make any commits, it's important to set your identity (name and email) so that Git can track who made the changes. This information is associated with your commits.

Note :- (--global makes these settings apply to all repositories on your system.
If you want to set user info for just one repository, omit --global.)
