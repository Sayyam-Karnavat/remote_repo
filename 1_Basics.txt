# Git :- Git is a distributed version control system, which means it tracks changes to files over time. Every "commit" in Git is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Version control allows developers to collaborate on projects, track changes, and revert to previous versions when necessary.

# Github :- It is website that allows developers to store and manage their code using Git



Three steps when it comes to github changes
 - add 
 - commit 
 - push

# We can run git commands from visual studio code as well , open terminal on dropdown select gitbash



## Configuring git bash
    

 - git config --global user.name "My Name" : - (This command sets your Git username to "My Name" for all repositories on your machine. The --global flag means this setting applies to every Git repository you work with on this system)
 - git config --global user.email "sample@gmail.com" (Similar to the previous command, this sets your email address for all Git repositories globally. This email is used in your commits to identify you as the author.)
 - git config --global --list
 - git config --global init.defaultBranch main :- Set the default branch name to main (optional)
